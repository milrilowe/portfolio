# Guitar-Piano

A tool that maps keys on a piano to frets on a guitar and vice versa.

## Introduction

This project provides a visual way to understand the relationship between the notes on a guitar and a piano. You can click on a key or a fret and see the corresponding note light up on the other instrument. Additionally, you can create chords on one instrument to see them on the other.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your system. Once you have Node.js set up, you can clone the repository and run the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
``` 

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

To use the application, simply open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. From there, you can click on a key or a fret to see the corresponding note light up on the other instrument.
